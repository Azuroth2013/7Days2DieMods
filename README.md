Self-made mods for 7 Days To Die

Mods and Modlets will be stored here that I have created for the game 7 Days to Die. I've enjoyed playing the game so much that I decided to start working on making my own mods for it and not always having to wait for others to develop things that I want to see in the game. 

If you find any issue please submit a issue request so that I can work to fix it. 

If you would like to make a pull request, those are welcomed as well.
